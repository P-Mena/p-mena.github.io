# Portfolio Project

Welcome to my portfolio project!

This project includes:

## üìÑ HTML Files

**Two HTML files:**

-   `index.html` ‚Äì Presents the main layout and structure of the site.
-   `contact.html` ‚Äì Contains contact information and a small interactive element.

Each page is structured using `div` elements and semantic sections for clarity and accessibility.

## ‚ú® JavaScript Interaction

In `contact.html`, you'll find a **small JavaScript snippet** that adds basic interactivity:

-   A **"New Encouragement"** button at the bottom of the page displays a random motivational quote when clicked.

This demonstrates how even simple JavaScript can improve user experience in a static project.

## üé® Styling

-   **A CSS file** that defines all the styling rules.
-   **A folder with resources** (images and assets) used to style the website.

## üì± Responsive Design

The layout has been adapted for various screen sizes, including **desktop**, **tablet**, and **mobile** devices.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots
